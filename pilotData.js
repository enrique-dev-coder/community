          The Basset-Avocado Advanced Energy Community (BAAEC) is the master
          prosumer pilot. The award-winning consortium is deploying an
          innovative and versatile model focused on providing affordable,
          locally produced renewable energy and energy services at scale within
          a disadvantaged community. The BAAEC, a 28,000-resident community will
          serve enrolled participants using a complex system comprised of seven

          The vision for the Santa Ana Environmental Justice Innovation Zone
          project is to create decarbonization benefits in disadvantaged
          communities (DACs) while providing affordable, reliable energy in a
          way that benefits both customers and the electricity grid. The goal of
          the project is to demonstrate and quantify the benefits of aggregated
          assets in a flagship mixed-use multifamily development.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 text-sm">
          The project is a multi-parcel low-rise design in Santa Ana. The
          proposed design will replace an underutilized, 1960’s C-class office
          complex with 160 apartments in 4 stories.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          The emerging energy transition and the urge to decarbonize highlight
          the need for innovative smart social housing with integrated electric
          transportation. The project is a new model of urban development that
          combines 100% electric affordable housing with 100% electric
          Micro-Transit Hubs. Micro-Transit Hubs are last-mile electric vehicles
          serviced, owned, and operated by members of the community. This
          integrated approach fulfills two significant societal needs:
          affordable housing and employment. Combining affordable housing with
          access to transportation enables job creation. Beyond last mile 100%
          zero-emission delivery services, the hub also connects with the city’s
          mass transit systems streamlining transportation and facilitating
          access in and out of the innovation zone.

          We aim to implement version 2.0 of our CEC winning project “The
          Basset-Avocado Advanced Energy Community (BAAEC)” and create “Santa
          Monica Prosumer Community”. Our consortium will deploy an innovative
          and versatile model focused on providing affordable, locally produced
          renewable energy and energy services at scale within a disadvantaged
          community creating a flagship decarbonization and innovation zone. The
